What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Well basiclly I just saing to git, hey git look up for this folder, which is important to me now. I want you to keep eye on it, to keep changes.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Staging area is like a drower, that we can put things related each other and after that made one logic commit to out repository.
